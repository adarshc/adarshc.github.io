                        <h2>About me...</h2>
                        <p>
                            I think a good introduction could be an honest response to the three questions
                            "<i>Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?</i>", as appropriately posed by
                            Paul Gaugin's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_Do_We_Come_From%3F_What_Are_We%3F_Where_Are_We_Going%3F">famous artwork</a>
                            with the same title.</p>
                        <p>
                            Somebody special to me asked me the first part of this question very recently and very naturally
                            I could only think of my native origins as a personal response to this question. I come from
                            the small town of Jolly Grant situated at the foothills of Uttarakhand, somwhere near
                            Dehradun and Rishikesh for reference.</p>
                        <p>
                            Regarding the second part, I identify as a professional with a purpose to solve real-world
                            problems through my knowledge and skills in science and technology. I also consider myself
                            as an everlong student by spirit who has a lot to learn about the secrets of universe and
                            answers to certain questions which life keeps throwing at you.
                        </p>
						<p>
                            Regarding the third part, I feel the need to take a retrospective approach for this one.
                            <a href="#experiences">My Experiences</a> have brought me here, to this date (7th June, 2020)
                            and to this place in life, and I believe have always been guided by a curiosity for knowledge
                            and experiences that interest me and I feel lacking. Some of them were chance choices that
                            were made for them by those whom I trust, and some of them were consciously chosen by me as
                            I best saw fit.<br>
                            Regardless of the paths taken and intersections faced, a desire to better myself, both professionally
                            and personally, while enjoying the wonders of life, has always guided me. The more I know,
                            the more I realise how little I know. This is a constant humbling experience and a reminder
                            to be grateful of all the good things and good times that come my way.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                <p>
                    I think effective living and learning are synonymous to quite an extent - as long as you are sensing,
                    analysing and assimilating the experiences you undergo, you are learning and growing with time.<br>
                    Through my humble and fair share of experiences, I believe I have acquired the following interests and
                    my continued involvement in them have made me realized my strengths in them.

						<h2>Programming</h2>
						<p>
                            I love to see problems being solved through code and I belive we are living in an era where
                            our universal dependence on computers has made this even more evident.<br>
                            I enjoy coding in general and have acquired proficiency in a couple of them (C++, Java, Python).
                            Regardless of the programming language, there's a beauty in the universality and accessibility
                            to collaborate and realise ideas (individually or in a group) through code.

						<h2>Computer Architecture</h2>
						<p>
                            My undergrad experience made me interested in this classical fields of computer science.
                            The boundary between hardware and software is amazing in its own way and gives one a microscopic
                            perspective and sense of harmony in how the code translates to electronic signals which achieve
                            the objectives of one's ideation.<br>
                            I learned a lot about micro-processors specifically and what are the engineering challenges
                            in implementing features which deliver performance, with insights into other components and
                            their interactions with the processor.

						<h2>Machine Learning</h2>
						<p>
                            I did my grad thesis in Deep Learning, the hot-topic under the ML umbrella. It was very enlightening
                            and interesting from the perspective of mathematically modeling human-like cognitive abilities
                            and implementing them on modern computers to assit humanity through ingenius applications.<br>
                            I understood a lot about under-the-hood stuff in modern neural networks and how computer vision
                            field is limited by large manual annotation requirement.

                            While I'm still new to the field, I'm continuously learning a lot everyday about how large-scale
                            software services, provided by the giants like Google, are implemented and made feasible with
                            a service quality to make it usable for everyone around the globe.<br>
                            I am excited to start contributing and engineering my ideas in solving problems through cloud

						<h2>Problem Solving</h2>

                            myself with problems that can feedback in enhancing my problem solving abilities even further.

						<h2>Arts and Literature</h2>
						<p>
                            I search for and enjoy all forms of art (artworks, literature, music, or cinema) because I find
                            many of them intellectually stimulating and involving. I think they are important not just for
                            indulgence as something to occupy ourselves and spend our time with, but rather serve an important
                            purpose intended by the artist that we are supposed to receive by participating with it intellectually.<br>
                            I have a special inclination for literature and love reading books of all kinds. They help me
                            think about things that may physically lie beyond my experiences but are accessible in the realm
                            of ideas and consciousness.

                <p>
                    At some point in life, I think all of use ponder about life and try to find answers to questions that

                    "<a href="https://hitchhikers.fandom.com/wiki/42">What is the meaning of life?</a>" might be

                    words of wisdom from various people that I've met and certain books that I've read have helped me
                    in the process of pursuing it.<br>
                    Here are a couple of them which I feel like sharing as something special to my mind and heart.
